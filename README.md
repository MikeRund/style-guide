>A style guide is a set of standards [which] establish and enforce style to improve communication.

For now, the **visual** and **coding styles** [will live in the _same repo_](https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015/issues/22). If the size of this readme gets out of hand or if we have a lot of requests to separate them, we'll do so.

##Why?
**Consistency**.    

Every developer likes to do things their own way.    
Even though we have our own idea of what maintainable code looks like, _the important thing isn't how many spaces we indent our code with_ but that **everything is consistent** so new people _don't have to work through personal formatting quirks_ of previous developers and can **focus on the code**.
